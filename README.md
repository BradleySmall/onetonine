The number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 can have either the operator "+" or "-" placed between them.
As well, if no operator is placed, then the adjoining numbers go together such as 1 2 would 
become "12" or 1 2 3 would become "123" and so forth. 

The goal is to find the combinations that would make the line calculate up to 100 exactly.

Here is an example: 12 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 67 + 8 + 9 = 100

Would like maybe something other than eval().
